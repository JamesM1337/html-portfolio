<h1>Great Movies according to James</h1>
<h2>My top 3 favourite films of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Casino</h3>
<p>This is Joe Pesci at his most violent, ruthless self in this epic money laundering blockbuster that entertains every time</p>
<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>Tim Robbins & Morgan freeman both give acting masterclasses in this breathless tale of morality and prison survival</p>
<h3>Deer Hunter</h3>
<p>The first hour of this film succeeds in portraying an unreakable friendship between a group of men who are then cruelly thrown into the bloody, savage reality of the Vietnam war</p>
